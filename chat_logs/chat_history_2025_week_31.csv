It includes tools for pricing, materials management, and lab workflow automation. You can create new lab tests by clicking + Create record and filling in the required parameters. The lab test will then appear in the Lab Tests List.

The LIS module also has a Units section designed to manage the measurement units used for laboratory tests and their results. Correct units are essential for ensuring accurate interpretation of results and maintaining standardization across the system.

The system also allows for the creation and management of lab orders. You can track lab orders from all doctors and departments, and there are various filtering and search tools available. The system also allows for the customization of how lab orders and results are printed, barcode label parameters, and how external integrations behave. 

For urgent help, you can mark your ticket as High Priority, and the team will get to it as soon as possible. You can track the status of your request from your Helpdesk dashboard and receive updates via email when support staff respond."
